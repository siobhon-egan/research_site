## Text editors

The first step in your coding journey is to download yourself a good text editor.
While you most systems come with a basic built-in editor (e.g. `TextEdit` for MacOS or `notepad` for windows) its best to find one you like early one.

My favourite is [atom](https://atom.io/) - which is **FREE**.   

Others include:

* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - **PAID**
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
* [TextMate](https://macromates.com/)

## Etherpad

An etherpad is an excellent tool to use for teaching and workshops. It provides a communal notepad that everyone can access - provide a single link and you can drop in any information, bits of code, webpage links, resources etc in this central place rather than having people rely on copying code correctly from a screen.
