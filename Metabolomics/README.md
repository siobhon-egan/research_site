- [xcms](https://github.com/sneumann/xcms) R package. Framework for processing and visualization of chromatographically separated and single-spectra mass spectral data. Imports from AIA/ANDI NetCDF, mzXML, mzData and mzML files. Preprocesses data for high-throughput, untargeted analyte profiling. [Vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/xcms/inst/doc/xcms-lcms-ms.html)
- [MSnbase](http://lgatto.github.io/MSnbase/) - an R/Bioconductor package that provides infrastructure for plotting, manipulation and processing mass spectrometry and proteomics data.
