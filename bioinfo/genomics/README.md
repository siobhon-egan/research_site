# General genomic resources

* Galaxy links - Galaxy is a scientific workflow, data integration, and data and analysis persistence and publishing platform that aims to make computational biology accessible to research scientists that do not have computer programming or systems administration experience.
    - [Where to use galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/use/)
    - [Galaxy tutorials](https://galaxyproject.org/learn/)
    - [Galaxy Australia](https://usegalaxy.org.au/)
* [Australian BioComms](https://www.biocommons.org.au/) and [BioPlatforms](https://bioplatforms.com/biocommons/) - Australian centeric resources and community aimed at enhancing and training in all things big data.
* [Pawsey Super Computing Centre](https://pawsey.org.au/) - A Tier-1, High Performance Computing facility in Australia, whose primary function is to accelerate scientific research for the benefit of the nation.
* [EMBL Australia](https://www.emblaustralia.org/) - EMBL Australia is a life science network that supports ambitious research projects and provides access to infrastructure and training to early-career Australian scientists.

# Databases

* [TriTrypDB](https://tritrypdb.org/tritrypdb/) - kinetoplastid genomics resource
* [VectorBase](https://www.vectorbase.org/downloads) - bioinformatics resource for invertebrate vectors of human pathogens
* [CryptoDB](https://cryptodb.org/cryptodb/) - *Cryptosporidium* genomics resource
* [Silva](https://www.arb-silva.de/) - high quality ribosomal RNA databases. SILVA provides comprehensive, quality checked and regularly updated datasets of aligned small (16S/18S, SSU) and large subunit (23S/28S, LSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences for all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya).
* [Greengenes](https://greengenes.secondgenome.com/) - 16S rRNA gene database of Bacteria and Archaea.
* [EuPathDB](https://eupathdb.org/eupathdb/) - Eukaryotic pathogen database resource
* [unite](https://unite.ut.ee/) - communication and identification of DNA based fungal species (based on internal transcribed spacer gene - ITS)
* [BoldSystems](http://v3.boldsystems.org/index.php/resources/handbook?chapter=2_databases.html) - The Barcode of Life Data System is designed to support the generation and application of DNA barcode data. Includes the following: Animal identification using mitochondrial mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI); Fungal using internal transcribed spacer (ITS); and Plant using chloroplast ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase (RbcL) & plastid/nuclear Maturase K (Matk)
* [VEuPathDB](https://veupathdb.org/) - This NIH Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC) will support the integration of parasite resources currently provided by EuPathDB.org, fungal resources provided by FungiDB.org, and vector resources provided by VectorBase.org.
